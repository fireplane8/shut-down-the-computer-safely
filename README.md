There are many benefits to **shutting down your computer properly**. If you simply close your laptop after each use, your computer could experience degraded performance over time. Also, if you don’t use features that lock access to your device, simply closing the notebook means that anybody nearby could quickly have access to your open documents and sessions


## Steps for shutting down your computer properly
Simply tapping the power button will likely only put your machine in sleep or hibernation mode, and holding the button down to force your computer off could damage software or lead to data loss.

**Here’s how to shut down your computer properly.**

### 1. Save your progress
Many modern-day applications save progressively or at least will do so before you exit the program. This isn’t always the case, however, so go ahead and press **“Save”** on your open documents to ensure everything is up to date.

If you’ve kept several tabs open in your browser that you don’t want to lose, simply use bookmarks so you can come back to them later.

### 2. Log off from social media
This practice is a must for instances where you’ll be closing out of a shared computer or just putting it into sleep mode, but it may be a good idea to end any open social media sessions even if you’re shutting down your computer. This minimizes the risk that anybody will be able to exploit your account from that machine.

### 3. Close all open applications
Be sure to exit any programs you have open. Verify that they’re closed and not just minimized. You can quit some apps simply by closing them, while others may require you to complete a specific action. Alternatively, you can shut down the system as is and opt to reopen all the same windows and tabs upon restarting.

### 4. Log out of your user account
Once your apps are closed, if you’re on a shared computer like a library laptop, you’ll want to ensure that you’ve logged off. Exit your user session before closing the computer, and return the device or shut it down as needed.

### 5. Shut down your computer properly
If you’re using the Microsoft Windows operating system, click the Start button, which looks like a Windows icon, in the bottom left corner of your screen. Then, depending on which version of the operating system you’re using, you’ll either simply select **“Shut down”** or you’ll first click **“Power”** and then **“Shut down.”**

MacOS users will select the Apple menu with the Mac icon and then click **“Shut Down.”**

To shut down a Chromebook, click the time in the bottom right corner of your screen, then navigate to **“Sign out”** and **“Shut down.”**
